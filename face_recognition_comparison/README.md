Explanation:

The program starts by trying to open the `existing_faces.pkl` file and loading the data into the `existing_faces` list. If the file does not exist, it will initialize an empty list.

The program captures frames from the webcam, detects faces, compares them to the existing faces, and adds new faces to the list just like before.

When the program exits, it saves the `existing_faceslist` to the `existing_faces.pkl` file using the `picklelibrary`, which allows you to save complex data structures like lists and dictionaries to a file.

The next time the program is launched, it will try to open the `existing_faces.pkl` file and load the data into the `existing_faces` list, so the list of existing faces will persist across launches.

This way, the program will use the stored list of existing faces to compare new faces and add only new faces to the list, avoiding duplicates.

Note:

The pickle is used to store python object and it's not recommended to use it with untrusted data as it could lead to security issues.
The existing_faces.pkl file should be stored in a secure location and should be protected from unauthorized access.
If you don't need the list of existing faces to persist across launches, you can remove the parts of the code that deal with the file.
