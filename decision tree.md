Here is another Python program for a pattern recognition project, this time using a decision tree to classify handwritten digits:

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets, tree
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = datasets.load_digits()

# Extract the features and labels
features = mnist.data
labels = mnist.target

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Create a decision tree classifier
classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the classifier
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

This code is similar to the previous examples, but it uses a decision tree classifier instead of an SVM or k-NN classifier. The rest of the code is the same, with the classifier being trained on the training set and its performance being evaluated on the test set.
