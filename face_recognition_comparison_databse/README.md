Explanation:

1. The existing_names dictionary is created to store the names of the recognized faces, with the index of the corresponding face in the existing_faces list as the value, and the name as the key.
2. When a new face is detected, the program prompts the user to enter a name for the new face, adds the face to the existing_faces list, adds the name and index to the existing_names dictionary, and saves the face as a jpeg file with the name entered by the user.

When a recognized face is detected, the program retrieves the name of the person from the existing_names dictionary using the index of the face in the existing_faces list and prints the name.
At the end of the program, it saves the existing_faces list and existing_names dictionary to the existing_faces.pkl file using the pickle library, so that the list of existing faces and their names persist across launches.
This way, the program will use the stored list of existing faces to compare new faces and add only new faces to the list, avoiding duplicates, and also associate a name for the recognized faces, and save the image for new faces.
